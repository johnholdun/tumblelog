# tumblelog.php
## host your own damn tumblelog

Here's an early version of a self-hosted tumblr-like tumblelog.

- Multiple post types
- Single-user only
- Files stored in plain text (Yaml)
- Doesn't need to be at root (e.g. yourdomain.com/tumblelog)
- Custom post slugs (e.g. yourdomain.com/tumblelog/neat-new-post)
- Probably lots of security vulnerabilities

Pull requests very welcome. Let's make 'em sweat.
