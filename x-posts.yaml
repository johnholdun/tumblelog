    <p>Delta Dreamflight, n\xC3\xA9e If You Had Wings, now known as Buzz Lightyear&#8217;s Space Ranger Spin (of which only the track layout is unchanged, and has in fact never changed throughout all the lives of this attraction, fun fact) was, as I recall, the highlight of my first trip to Walt Disney World some fifteen years ago, for some reason. I rode the thing with my dad four or five times consecutively while Mom waited outside with Zach, my newborn brother. I remember feeling ever so slightly embarrassed, asking the attendant at the end of the queue if I could ride again and again. I don&#8217;t know why I was ashamed and I also don&#8217;t know why I was asking permission.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The ride broke down on one of our last trips through and we watched the storybook tableau rotate over and over for what felt like twenty minutes but was probably five. Which is also about how long this audio track is and I&#8217;m pretty sure this is the whole thing. So, short ride.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I remember the main reason&#8212;perhaps the only reason&#8212;I wanted to ride it so many times was the sequence where we travel through a sort of <a href=\"http://found.boxofjunk.ws/post/2173202880\">black hole-looking</a> tunnel, lights rotating clockwise. I was convinced that <em>we</em> were tilting, too, ever so slightly. I remember hanging my Goofy hat from my hand on one of the go-rounds, trying to tell if we were really leaning or if it was just an illusion caused by the environment. The results were inconclusive, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the Omnimovers can&#8217;t do that&#8212;that&#8217;s sort of the point of the Omnimovers&#8212;so I think my conclusion finally is that no, that&#8217;s not what was happening.

     was that I was going to be sepia-toned. It was decided that this would not have really worked. Apparently it could have. This woman is awesome. (via <a href="http://harrisj.tumblr.com/post/2156158096/desaturated-santa-returns-to-san-francisco" class="tumblr_blog">harrisj</a>)</p>
